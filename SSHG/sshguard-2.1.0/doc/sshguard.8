[\fB\-b\fP \fIthreshold\fP:\fIblacklist_file\fP]
[\fB\-i\fP \fIpidfile\fP]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBsshguard\fP protects hosts from brute\-force attacks against SSH and other
services. It aggregates system logs and blocks repeat offenders using one of
several firewall backends.
.sp
\fBsshguard\fP can monitor log files or read log messages from standard input.
Log messages are parsed line\-by\-line for recognized patterns. An attack is
detected when several patterns are matched in a set time interval. Attackers
are blocked temporarily but can also be semi\-permanently banned using the
blacklist option.
.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-a\fP \fIthreshold\fP (default 30)
Block attackers when their cumulative attack score exceeds \fIthreshold\fP\&.
Most attacks have a score of 10.
.TP
.B \fB\-b\fP \fIthreshold\fP:\fIblacklist_file\fP
Blacklist an attacker when its score exceeds \fIthreshold\fP\&. Blacklisted
addresses are loaded from and added to \fIblacklist\-file\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-i\fP \fIpidfile\fP
Write the PID of \fBsshguard\fP to \fIpidfile\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-p\fP \fIblocktime\fP (default 120)
Block attackers for initially \fIblocktime\fP seconds after exceeding
\fIthreshold\fP\&. Subsequent blocks increase by a factor of 1.5.
.sp
\fBsshguard\fP unblocks attacks at random intervals, so actual block times
will be longer.
.TP
.B \fB\-s\fP \fIdetection_time\fP (default 1800)
Remember potential attackers for up to \fIdetection_time\fP seconds before
resetting their score.
.TP
.B [\fB\-w\fP \fIaddress\fP | \fIwhitelist_file\fP]
Whitelist a single address, hostname, or address block given as
\fIaddress\fP\&. This option can be given multiple times. Alternatively,
provide an absolute path to a \fIwhitelist_file\fP containing addresses to
whitelist. See \fI\%WHITELISTING\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-h\fP
Print usage information and exit.
.TP
.B \fB\-v\fP
Print version information and exit.
.UNINDENT
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B SSHGUARD_DEBUG
Set to enable verbose output from sshg\-blocker.
.UNINDENT
.SH FILES
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B %PREFIX%/etc/sshguard.conf
See sample configuration file.
.UNINDENT
.SH WHITELISTING
.sp
Whitelisted addresses are never blocked. Addresses can be specified on the
command line or be stored in a file.
.sp
On the command line, give the \fB\-w\fP option one or more times with an IP
address, CIDR address block, or hostname as an argument. Hostnames are
resolved once at startup. If a hostname resolves to multiple addresses, all
of them are whitelisted. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
sshguard \-w 192.168.1.10 \-w 192.168.0.0/24 \-w friend.example.com
    \-w 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334
    \-w 2002:836b:4179::836b:0000/126
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If the argument to \fB\-w\fP begins with a forward slash (\(aq/\(aq) or dot (\(aq.\(aq),
the argument is treated as the path to a whitelist file.
.sp
The whitelist file contains comments (lines beginning with \(aq#\(aq), addresses,
address blocks, or hostnames, one per line.
